This week we will be visited by representatives from Citizens Bank. 
They will talk about career opportunities available to CS students.
This is a great way to get your foot in the door and get your résumé out there!
We strongly encourage everyone who attends to bring their friends.
We do ask that you fill out 2 forms this time - one for the RamHacks attendance and the other to register for the event.
You can also use the QR code below to register!
