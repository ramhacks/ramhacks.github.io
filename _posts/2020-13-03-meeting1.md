This week we will be competing against each other in programming tourneys on [CodeSignal](https://codesignal.com/). 
CodeSignal allows you to compete using several different programming languages. So if you 
are not yet comfortable with a programming language like C or C++, you can opt for Python or other
languages that you are more familiar with. 
Please sign up beforehand so that we can start the fun right away!
