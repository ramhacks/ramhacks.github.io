For our sixth meeting, RamHacks will again be conducting programming tourneys featured on [Codesignal](https://codesignal.com). We will have one longer tourney(about 20 - 30 minutes in duration) to give members time to finish the programming challenges. We will also have several shorter tourneys for practice in a faster paced environment. 

Here is the attendance for meeting 6!
