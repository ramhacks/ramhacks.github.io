Hello all! This Thursday, November 21, a local elementary school is having STEAM Night! Volunteers will need to provide their own
transportation but the school where the event is held is located less than a mile from campus. The night will feature
about 18 interactive stations that the kids can experience.

Volunteers are needed for:
4-6 PM: Event set-up
5:30-7:30 PM: Event with kids (most volunteers needed at this time)

Volunteers can help for both shifts, which would be 4-7:30 PM.

Organizers are really interested in connecting the elementary students with URI students in science, technology, engineering, arts, and math! 
You all are great role models for these kids!
