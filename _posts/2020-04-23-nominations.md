Good afternoon Rams!
As the semester ends, RamHacks must hold elections for the board for next semester. We will hold nominations and then hold elections after receiving nominations. 
We do not have much time as the end of the semester is approaching quickly. Below is a link to the form for nominating someone to be part of the board. 
Many of our current admin are seniors and will graduate this semester, including myself. We have a few open positions: Treasurer, Vice President, and President. 
If anyone would like to nominate themselves or someone else for another position(Secretary, Web Development Officer),
that is fine as well, but keep in mind that we have 2 great members currently doing a great job in those positions(Thank you Ben and Mike). 


Nominate yourself or others here!(don't be shy):
