Hello all! This Thursday, November 21, a local elementary school is having STEAM Night! Volunteers will need to provide their own
transportation but the school where the event is held is located less than a mile from campus. The night will feature
about 18 interactive stations that the kids can experience.

You all are great role models for these kids!


#INFORMATION FOR STEAM NIGHT

The school is West Kingston Elementary School and itâ€™s located at 3119 Ministerial Road, West Kingston, RI. Plains Road on the west side of campus turns into Ministerial after you cross Rt 138. Once you cross 138 the school is on your left (enter at the second entrance with the sign for the school). The school is set off the road and behind a wooded area that is adjacent to the road.  

Set-up is 4:30 - 6:00 PM 
Volunteering for event is 5:30 - 7:30 PM (most volunteers needed at this time)

We have no idea what the front entrance will look like that night as there has been construction going on. We are hoping it will be all set and we can enter the school that way.  Once you come in, please find Lisa Kuosmanen or Becky Yedlowski to check in and get an assigned station for the night as well as a name tag.  If you are coming for set up (4:30-6:00), we will assign you to an area to set up.

If you will be joining us for the actual event (6-7:30ish), please try to arrive by 5:30 at the LATEST (earlier better) so we can explain your station. Some families like to come early. Your main role is helping families understand the goal/directions at the station. You can certainly assist families that have multiple children, but parents should really be helping their children. If a child comes to your station without a parent, please let them know they have to have a parent with them to participate in the station. You will also be in charge of keeping an eye on our supplies and materials. We are borrowing some items from the school/teachers and want to return them intact.Try to limit students to the time frame on the directions. Some stations may take longer than listed, but try to move them along as soon as they finish a project. There will be a stamp at your station for you to stamp the child's passport after they have finished.  

We're sure there will be more that night to cover, but this is a good start.  We REALLY appreciate your willingness to help out that night and look forward to seeing everyone Thursday.
