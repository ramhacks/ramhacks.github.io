The time has finally come. This week, we will have our first Linux Night!
We will be installing a popular Linux distribution called **Ubuntu**. We will use **Virtualbox** for this.
Everything is free so no need to worry about cost. For this you will need to bring your laptops.
You should have a reasonable amount of storage(say, at minimum 8 Gigabytes and ideally 16+ Gigabytes free). 
A Reasonable amount of RAM is useful as well. 8 Gigabytes should suffice, but more RAM will make your life easier.
These are suggestions and it is possible to do with less storage and memory but if you are planning to 
do anything serious, you will want more. 

Here is the attendance for meeting 8!

####This event is in Tyler Hall Room 103 at 6pm on Thursday October 31, 2019
