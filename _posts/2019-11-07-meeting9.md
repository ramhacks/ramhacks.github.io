This week RamHacks will be conducting Linux Night Part 2! Last time, we did not have enough time to install everything. 
That is why this time, the ubuntu iso will be available on a USB for faster and easier downloads! However, we do recommend
that you come with [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) with the extension pack and [Ubuntu 18.04](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
downloaded and installed on your computer as we will only be going over the process of how to create a virtual machine using the iso and Virtualbox.
In between downloads and installation, we will talk about the basic commands that you will find useful if you decide to switch.
By the end of the night, members should have a good enough understanding of Linux to know if it is worth switching to or not!

Here is the attendance for meeting 9!

### Join us in Tyler Hall Room 053 at 6pm on Thursday November 07, 2019
