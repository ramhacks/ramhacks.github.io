For our fifth meeting, we will conduct our own coding tournament! 
This will consist of several smaller coding tourneys. 
To participate in the tourneys, please sign up for [CodeSignal](https://codesignal.com).
It is of course, completely free and a great resource to learn how to code or just to have fun!
Of course, we will have pizza üçï this week, so join us for A True Programmer's Experience.

Here is the attendance for meeting 5!
