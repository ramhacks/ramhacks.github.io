# Ram Hacks - Computer Science Interest Group Homepage

RAM Hacks is a student-run club at the [University of Rhode Island](cs.uri.edu). We welcome everyone, regardless of whether you are a computer science major, to learn and talk about programming software, working with hardware, or any related topic. No prior experience is necessary or expected. If you are looking to get started, further your knowledge, or share what you already know, there is no better place!

### What we do:

* Programming challenges
* Working on cool projects
* Robotics
